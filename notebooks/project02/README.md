# Jordan Project 02
### Author:  [JfromNWMS](https://github.com/JfromNWMS)

## Overview
This project uses seaborn's Titanic dataset to demonstrate pre-processing of data before splitting for analysis and to compare splitting methods.  The dataset is cleaned and inspected before comparisons between standard pseudo-random splitting and stratified spliting are made.

This project is a guided notebook assignment that demonstrates how to:
- Load and explore a dataset.
- Choose and justify features for predicting a target variable.
- Check for class distributions of pseudo-random and stratified test-train-split methods.
- Document work in a structured Jupyter Notebook.

A link to the notebook can be found here: [ml02_jordan.ipynb](https://github.com/JfromNWMS/applied-ml-jordan/blob/main/notebooks/project02/ml02_jordan.ipynb)

This project utilizes a module for calculating Tukey's fences.  The module can be found here: [stats_jordan.py](https://github.com/JfromNWMS/applied-ml-jordan/blob/main/src/stats_jordan.py)

## Dataset  
- We use the built-in dataset from seaborn:  
   - [Titanic-Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

## Instructions to Set up Virtual Environment

Run these commands in your VS Code terminal:

```shell
# 1. Create an isolated virtual environment
uv venv

# 2. Pin a specific Python version (3.12 recommended)
uv python pin 3.12

# 3. Install all dependencies, including optional dev/docs tools
uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade

# 4. Enable pre-commit checks so they run automatically on each commit
uv run pre-commit install

# 5. Verify the Python version (should show 3.12.x)
uv run python --version
```

Next, activate the virtual environment.

Windows (PowerShell):

```script
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

macOS / Linux / WSL:

```script
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Instructions to Run Jupyter Notebook Locally

### Install the Jupyter Extension for VS Code:

Open the Extensions view in VS Code by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+X (Mac).
Search for "Jupyter" and install the official extension.
Open the notebook in VS Code. The file will have a .ipynb extension.

### Task 1. Select Notebook Kernel
Open the notebook (.ipynb) file in VS Code.
If prompted, select a Python interpreter that corresponds to your projectâ€™s .venv.
If not prompted:
Click the Kernel Selector in the top-right corner.
Choose the interpreter labeled with your project name and path.
Or open the Command Palette (Ctrl Shift P / Cmd Shift P) and run: Python: Select Interpreter, then pick your .venv.

### Task 2. Start and Run the Notebook
To run notebooks directly in VS Code, click on a cell and press:
<br>Shift Enter to run cell and move to next
<br>Ctrl Enter to run cell and stay in place
<br>Save often or enable File / Auto Save.
